## Problem statement:
Github provides API(s) to access the different components on its platform.
You are provided with the following files:

This is a postman collection having the github API(s) (can be accessed by importing “https://github.com/cdhiraj40/Gramoday-Task/blob/main/Github%20Browser%20APIs.postman_collection.json” file in POSTMAN*).


ii. “Github Browser – Wireframes.pdf”
This is the wireframe which should be used to generate screens in the android app. The
components of each screen are shown in the https://github.com/cdhiraj40/Gramoday-Task/blob/main/Github%20Browser%20-%20Wireframes.pdf. The interactions on clicking each button
